Thank you for downloading and trying our code.

To use the code, set the number of training images(NUMTRAININGIMAGES), number of principle components (NUMPC) and the prefix of the training images (IMAGENAME).  The faults are 6,3, and "fixed" using the training images supplied.  The outputfiles will be the mean image (meanImage.mha) and the principle components titled pcImage0.mha, pcImage1.mha, and so on depending on the number of principle components.  The maximum number of output principle components is equal to N-1, where N is the number of training images.
